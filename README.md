# DCNavigator
A better way to navigate around DC

This site will serve as a repository for a tool or set of tools that enhance navigation and routing through the city.

While Google Maps is great for the majority of routing needs, there are several areas where it falls short:

1.  No realtime updates from WMATA transit systems.  As DC residents know, train and bus times deviate significantly from their pre-determined schedules, especially on the weekends and during planned or unplanned maintenance.  Unfortunately, Google Maps uses only published schedules for route planning in DC. By incorporating real time next bus and next train predicitions into route planning, DCNavigator should be able to propose alternate routes when buses and trains are experiencing significant delays.

2. No integration with the Captial Bikeshare system.  Google Maps has the capability to perform A to B bike routing but assumes that you have your own bike. For Capital Bikeshare subscribers, it would be beneficial to incorporate the location of bike stations and walk times into the routing algorithm.  Moreover, incorporating bikeshare trips into multimodal trip across the city may save signficant amounts of time in certain instances.

3. No cost information.  Google Maps suggested routes do not include cost information for public transit when this data is readily available.

4. No customization of bike or walk speeds.  Google's estimates for bike and walk speeds are generally considered slow 
for healthy adults.  These has the effect of falsely pushing walk/bike intensive routes down the list of suggested routes.
